# Python for Data Science and AI

This is the repository, mainly to prepare students to get acquainted with Python, before actually learning machine learning.  For those who are more interested in the advanced one, go to my other repository "Machine Learning"


### Outline

The repo is structured into 2 big components:

### 1. Python Basics
Focus on getting started.
  - Variables
  - List
  - Tuples, Dictionaries
  - Functions
  - Classes
  - Exception

### 2. Data Science
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
