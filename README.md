# Python for Data Science and AI

This is the repository for the course Python for Data Science and AI at Asian Institute of Technology.

### Prerequisites

1. Prerequisites/0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. Prerequisities/0 - Installation
  - For setting up tools for the course
3. Prerequisities/0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it
  
 ### Syllabus
 
Syllabus/0. Course Introduction.ipynb
 - Contains how I run the course.  This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.

### Credits

I would like to give credits to several githubs that I have revised to create this:

- https://github.com/SethHWeidman/DLFS_code
- https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook
- Awesome datacamp on PyTorch by Jose Marcial Portilla
- Many other awesome github heros (that I forget to reference...)

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Akraradet Sinsamersuk
- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit
- Chanapa Pananookooln
